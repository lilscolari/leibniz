## Features and examples of the language
Here are some features we plan to add to implement in the language:
| Feature    | Explanation |
| -------- | ------- |
| reserved words  |  to allow for easy integration of mathematical terminology   |
| optionals | safer handling of missing values |
| dynamically typed    | better for algebraic manipulation    |
| semicolons | to mark the end of a line |
| trig functions | to allow more mathematic versatility |
| shapes | to expand to geometry |
| vectors | to serve as lists and vectors in math |
| equations | data type to allow users to create their own equations which act like functions |
| error handling | for mathematical errors like division by zero |
| immutability | to ensure values do not change |
| pattern matching | useful when working with symbols and variables |
| auto-simplification | to make math problems less complex |

Here are some example programs for our language. As you can see, we plan to have a lot of built-in functionality for recurrent topics of math.

| -------- |
| deriv(y: x^2+6x, Optional[val:2]) = 10  |
| integrate(y: 3x^2+5x, Optional[a,b]) = x^3+(5/2)x^2+c |
| eval(2cos(x)-1); |
| arctan(1, output: degrees) = 45 |
| Triangle.area(b:5,h:8) = 20 |
| f(x, y) = {x * y;} |
| for (_ in domain(0, 100, Optional[step])) {} |
| distance(5m, 3s, output: mph) |
| eq = x^2 + 6x; deriv(eq, x=2); |
