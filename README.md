## 🧠 About the Project

Leibniz is a math-focused programming language created by **Cameron, Atul, Doug, and Artur**. Inspired by our shared passion for mathematics, we set out to build a language that makes mathematical computation more intuitive, expressive, and accessible.

Our goal is to allow users to seamlessly integrate powerful mathematical tools into their code, improving both readability and functionality.

The language is named after **Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz**, one of the inventors of calculus and the creator of the **Leibniz calculator**—one of the first machines capable of performing all four basic arithmetic operations. His influence on symbolic logic and mathematics makes him the perfect namesake.

## 🚀 Features

Leibniz currently supports:

- ✅ Function creation and calling  
- 🔁 `for` and `while` loops  
- 🧮 Basic arithmetic: negation, addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, and modulus  
- 🔣 Mathematical constants like `pi`  
- 📐 Built-in math functions: `cos`, `sin`, `domain`, etc.  
- ✍️ Variable declaration and assignment  
- 📤 Print statements  
- 🧾 Conditional statements with inequalities (`if-else`)  
- 🧱 Object (shape) declarations  
- 🧬 Symbolic differentiation (`derivative` function)  

With support for user-defined functions and shapes, Leibniz allows users to explore and analyze how different branches of mathematics interact through code.

## 🛑 Examples of Static Errors

| ❌ Error Message |
|------------------|
| Expected number |
| Expected a digit |
| Type mismatch |
| Expected number or string |
| Operands must have the same type |
| `x` not declared |
| Object `new_triangle` not found |
| Expected `"Circle"`, `"Rectangle"`, or `"Triangle"` |
| Rectangle requires **2 args** (base, height), got 1 |
| Triangle requires **2 args** (base, height), got 1 |
| Rectangle requires **2 args** (base, height), got 0 |
| Triangle requires **2 args** (base, height), got 0 |
| Circle requires **1 arg** (radius), got 2 |
| `diameter` is not a valid method for `Circle` |
| `circumference` is not a valid method for `Rectangle` |
| Cannot read properties of undefined (`type`) |
| `volume` is not a valid method for `Triangle` |
| Function `sin` expects **1 arg**, received 0 |

## 💻 Potential Example Programs

| Leibniz Code |
|--------------|
| `deriv(y: x^2+6x, Optional[val:2]) = 10` |
| `integrate(y: 3x^2+5x, Optional[a,b]) = x^3+(5/2)x^2+c` |
| `eval(2cos(x)-1);` |
| `arctan(1, output: degrees) = 45` |
| `Triangle.area(b:5,h:8) = 20` |
| `f(x, y) = {x * y;}` |
| `for (_ in domain(0, 100, Optional[step])) {}` |
| `distance(5m, 3s, output: mph)` |
| `eq = x^2 + 6x; deriv(eq, x=2);` |
