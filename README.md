Leibniz is a math-focused programming language created by Cameron, Atul, Doug, and Artur. Inspired by our shared passion for mathematics, we set out to build a language that makes mathematical computation more intuitive, expressive, and accessible. Our goal is to enable users to seamlessly integrate powerful mathematical tools into their code, improving both readability and functionality.
<br>
<br>
The language is named after Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, one of the inventors of calculus and the mind behind the Leibniz calculatorâ€”one of the earliest machines capable of performing all four basic arithmetic operations. His contributions to math and logic align closely with the goals of our language, making the name a perfect fit.

## Examples of static errors
| Example |
| ------- |
| Expected number |
| Expected a digit |
| Type mismatch |
| Expected number or string |
| Operands must have the same type |
| x not declared |
| Error: Object new_triangle not found. |
| Expected "Circle", "Rectangle", or "Triangle" |
| Error: Rectangle requires exactly 2 arguments (base, height), but got 1. |
| Error: Triangle requires exactly 2 arguments (base, height), but got 1. |
| Error: Rectangle requires exactly 2 arguments (base, height), but got 0. |
| Error: Triangle requires exactly 2 arguments (base, height), but got 0. |
| Error: Circle requires exactly 1 argument (radius), but got 2. |
| Error: diameter is not a valid method for Circle. |
| Error: circumference is not a valid method for Rectangle. |
| TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'type') |
| Error: volume is not a valid method for Triangle. |
| Error: Function sin expects 1 argument(s), but received 0 |

## Features of the language
| Feature    | Explanation |
| -------- | ------- |
| reserved words  |  to allow for easy integration of mathematical terminology   |
| optionals | safer handling of missing values |
| dynamically typed    | better for algebraic manipulation    |
| semicolons | to mark the end of a line |
| trig functions | to allow more mathematic versatility |
| shapes | to expand to geometry |
| vectors | to serve as lists and vectors in math |
| equations | data type to allow users to create their own equations which act like functions |
| error handling | for mathematical errors like division by zero |
| immutability | to ensure values do not change |
| pattern matching | useful when working with symbols and variables |
| auto-simplification | to make math problems less complex |

## Potential example programs

| leibniz    |
| -------- |
| deriv(y: x^2+6x, Optional[val:2]) = 10  |
| integrate(y: 3x^2+5x, Optional[a,b]) = x^3+(5/2)x^2+c |
| eval(2cos(x)-1); |
| arctan(1, output: degrees) = 45 |
| Triangle.area(b:5,h:8) = 20 |
| f(x, y) = {x * y;} |
| for (_ in domain(0, 100, Optional[step])) {} |
| distance(5m, 3s, output: mph) |
| eq = x^2 + 6x; deriv(eq, x=2); |
